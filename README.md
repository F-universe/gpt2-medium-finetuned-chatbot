GPT-2 Medium Fine-Tuned Chatbot
This repository provides a step-by-step guide for fine-tuning a GPT-2 Medium model as a chatbot on custom data. The chatbot can be trained on a specific topic and then queried for information based on its training.

(((Overview)))

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune GPT-2 Medium on specific content and then use it as a chatbot to answer related questions. The process involves two main scripts:

GPT-MEDIUM(1).PY: This script fine-tunes the GPT-2 Medium model on custom data.
GPT-MEDIUM.PY: This script loads the fine-tuned model and allows the user to query it for information.
(((Files in This Repository)))

GPT-MEDIUM(1).PY: Training script that fine-tunes the GPT-2 Medium model on a custom dataset. This script saves the trained model, allowing it to respond based on specific knowledge.

GPT-MEDIUM.PY: Interaction script that loads the fine-tuned model and allows for user queries. This serves as the main chatbot interface.

Prerequisites
Python: Version 3.6 or higher.
GPU (optional): Training on a GPU is recommended for faster processing.
Environment Setup
To keep dependencies organized, create a virtual environment. You can use either conda or virtualenv.

Using Conda
bash
Copia codice
conda create -n gpt2-chatbot python=3.8
conda activate gpt2-chatbot
Using Virtualenv
bash
Copia codice
python -m venv gpt2-chatbot
source gpt2-chatbot/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `gpt2-chatbot\Scripts\activate`
Installing Libraries
Install the necessary libraries, including Hugging Face transformers, torch, and datasets.

bash
Copia codice
pip install transformers torch datasets
Training the Model
Step 1: Edit GPT-MEDIUM(1).PY with Custom Training Data
Add the content you want the chatbot to learn to the text variable in GPT-MEDIUM(1).PY. For example:

python
Copia codice
# Custom training data
text = """
The wolf (Canis lupus) is the largest carnivore in the dog family (Canidae). Wolves usually live in packs, which are family groups...
"""
Step 2: Run the Training Script
After saving your custom text in GPT-MEDIUM(1).PY, run the script to start the fine-tuning process:

bash
Copia codice
python GPT-MEDIUM(1).PY
Upon completion, the model and tokenizer will be saved in a directory (e.g., ./gpt_finetuned), ready for interaction.

(((Interacting with the Trained Chatbot)))

To interact with your fine-tuned chatbot, use the GPT-MEDIUM.PY script. This file loads the trained model and allows you to input questions or prompts.

Example Usage
Run GPT-MEDIUM.PY and enter your query when prompted. The chatbot will generate responses based on its training data.

bash
Copia codice
python GPT-MEDIUM.PY
(((Troubleshooting Common Issues)))

Attention Mask Warning: If you see a warning about the attention mask, itâ€™s usually safe to ignore, but adding an attention_mask to generate calls may improve performance.

Repetitive Responses: If responses are repetitive, try adding more varied data or increasing training epochs.

Memory Errors: If memory issues occur, reduce per_device_train_batch_size or use a GPU.

By following these instructions, you can fine-tune GPT-2 Medium on custom content, save the model, and use it as a chatbot for specific, knowledge-based interactions.
